Acute disease and other events
==============================

The MSLT models presented here use a time-step size of 1 year.
So it is not sensible to talk about the **prevalence** of acute diseases (such
as lower respiratory tract infections) and acute events (such as road traffic
accidents), which may affect the all-cause mortality and YLD rate, but whose
duration is significantly less than that of a single time-step.

The acute events are therefore characterised in terms of two rates:

* Their excess mortality rate; and
* Their YLD rate.

An intervention could affect either or both of these rates.

For example, regular use of face masks could reduce the transmission of
respiratory infections, which would reduce the mortality and YLD rates for
respiratory infections.

Conversely, encouraging people to undertake short trips on foot could increase
the rate of pedestrian-vehicle collisions, which would increase the mortality
and YLD rates for road traffic accidents.
