Interventions
=============

We will consider three different interventions that affect the prevalence of
tobacco smoking.

Each of these interventions will affect the exposure distribution of the risk
factor (tobacco smoking).
This will be done by modifying any of the rates that affect the exposure
(i.e.,, the uptake and remission rates), or by moving people from one exposure
category to another.

.. note:: Another option, not explored here, is to modify the relative risk(s)
   associated with an exposure category.

Tobacco eradication
-------------------

For this intervention, we assume that tobacco is no longer available from some
specific year :math:`Y`.
This will have two effects:

* From year :math:`Y`, the uptake rate will be zero; and

* At year :math:`Y`, all current smokers will cease to smoke and their
  exposure category will be changed to **0 years post-cessation**.

Tobacco-free generation
-----------------------

For this intervention, we assume that individuals born after a certain year
:math:`Y` will be unable to purchase tobacco and therefore will never smoke.
This will have one effect (where we assume that all uptake occurs at age 21):

* From year :math:`Y + 21`, the uptake rate will be zero.

Tobacco tax
-----------

This is a more complex intervention, where we assume that there will be a
gradual tax increase that affects the price of cigarette packs, and that
tobacco uptake and cessation will be affected by the annual cost increase.

While the underlying details are more complex than the other interventions
outlined above, the effects of this intervention on tobacco smoking prevalence
are themselves simple:

* The uptake rate will be reduced by some proportion; and

* The cessation rate will be increased by some proportion.

Both of these effects will grow larger over time, since the tobacco price will
increase over time.

.. note:: The size of these effects will not necessarily vary in direct
   proportion to the price increases, due to price elasticity.
