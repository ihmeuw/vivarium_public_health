Multi-State Life Tables: chronic disease interventions
======================================================

In these tutorials, you will learn how to reproduce each of the simulations
presented in the paper "Multistate lifetable modelling of preventive
interventions: Concept and Python code".

After completing these tutorials, you will be able to adapt and modify these
simulations, to explore the impact of different model assumptions and
interventions, and to capture different simulation outputs of interest.

.. important:: These tutorials are intended to be followed in order, from
   first to last.

.. note:: The input data requirements for each of the MSLT components
   introduced in these tutorials are :ref:`described here <mslt_input_data>`.
