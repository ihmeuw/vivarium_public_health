Multi-State Life Tables: chronic disease interventions
======================================================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to reproduce each of the simulations
presented in the paper "Multistate lifetable modelling of preventive
interventions: Concept and Python code".

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to adapt and modify these
simulations, to explore the impact of different model assumptions and
interventions, and to capture different simulation outputs of interest.

.. note:: The input data requirements for each of the MSLT components
   introduced in these tutorials are :ref:`described here <mslt_input_data>`.
