Tobacco smoking: BAU scenario
=============================

.. todo:: Show the simulation definition.

Each chronic and acute disease that is affected by tobacco smoking is modelled
as a separate component, so that interventions on tobacco smoking can affect
the morbidity and mortality of these diseases.
We also need to inform the tobacco component which diseases it affects; this
is done in the configuration section.
