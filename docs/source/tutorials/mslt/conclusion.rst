Conclusion
==========

Now that you have completed these tutorials, you can extract subsets of the
simulation outputs and plot the effect of interventions on individual cohorts
over specific time periods. You can also change parameters in the model
specification files --- such as the time at which the tobacco eradication or
the tobacco-free generation intervention comes into effect --- and re-run
these simulations to see how your changes affect the intervention impact.

For further explorations, such as providing your own input data tables and
implementing custom risk factors and interventions, see the
:ref:`Advanced Topics <mslt_advanced>`.
