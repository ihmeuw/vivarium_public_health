Getting started
===============

- You need Python 3.6 or later installed. If you don't already have a suitable
  version of Python installed, the easiest option is to use
  `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`__.

- You need to install the ``vivarium_public_health`` Python package:

  .. Note that `pip` is the simplest way to do this when using Anaconda.

     https://www.anaconda.com/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment/

  .. code-block:: sh

     pip install vivarium_public_health

- Download the input data and model specification files
  `zip archive <https://github.com/collijk/mslt_port/archive/master.zip>`__,
  and unzip the contents; this will create a new directory called
  **mslt_port-master**.

  .. note:: This archive contains all of the files you will need in order to
     follow the tutorials.

  .. note:: We will probably need to change this link (and the directory name)
     to a canonical location.
